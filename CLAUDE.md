# Claude Instructions for knife project

- Use Go for investigations with cutter
- Practice dogfooding - use knife/cutter tools to analyze the knife codebase itself
- If the MCP cutter usability is poor or encounters issues, create GitHub issues to improve the user experience
- Do not give up and immediately resort to grep or rg - persist with cutter/knife tools
- If MCP error messages are unclear or hard to understand, improve them as well
